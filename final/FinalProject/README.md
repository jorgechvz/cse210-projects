# Inventory System Management

## About
The system will allow the store to manage its inventory efficiently by providing functionalities such as adding, editing and deleting products in real time. The system will be built using the principles of object-oriented programming, including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It will be designed to be modular, scalable and easy to maintain. It will also have a small database where the owner can keep all the information of his inventory, it will also have a login so that there is security that only authorized people use the inventory management system.

The system will help streamline inventory management and minimize the risk of stock-outs. Ultimately, this project aims to provide store owners with an intuitive, reliable and efficient tool to manage their inventory, allowing them to focus on growing their business and maximizing their profits.

## Usage
To use the program you must first do the authentication. You can see the user examples in this [File: info.txt](info.txt) or you can also create a new user to use the inventory.
After that you can have access to the inventory menu where you can create, view, edit, remove, sell your products. Whenever you log into your account, your inventory data will automatically load but keep in mind that saving is not automatic so every time you want to update some important information in your inventory make sure you do the saving.
To create a product you will have 4 categories which are clothing, food, technology and tools.
In the clothing category you will have to be sure to put the expiration date as the production date in this format: MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss . If you do not put it in that format, an error will appear when creating your product.
The functionality is simple, when you run the program you will see that there are several prompts to help you what to do in each feature of the program.
